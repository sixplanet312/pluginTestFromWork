# pluginTestFromWork

Part of a series of tests using GitHub from my IDE at home and work. Still experiencing some difficulties:

1. Making the repository in the IDE

2. Having to move projects and folders manually after cloning or creating a repository


Inside is a plugin for a Minecraft Spigot server.
